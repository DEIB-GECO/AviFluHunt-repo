# QUERIES

# QUERY ONE
query_one_label: "Select the Effects associated to a Mutation"
query_one_explanation: "<p style='text-align: justify;'>
This query returns all the <span class='keyword'>Effects</span> associated with a 
particular <span class='keyword'>Mutation</span>, and, if available, which specific 
<span class='domain'>host</span> the effect was found in or which 
<span class='domain'>drug</span> was the effect associated with.</p>

"
query_one_param_a_label: "Serotype:"
query_one_param_b_label: "Segment:"
query_one_param_c_label: "Mutation:"
query_one_examples: "Examples:<br>&emsp;- H5N1:NP:I41V<br>&emsp;- H5N1:HA1:N154S"
query_one_error: "<h5>No effect was found associated to mutation: </h5>"

# QUERY TWO
query_two_label: "Get all mutations by % human hosts"
query_two_explanation: "<p style='text-align: justify;'>
This query returns all the <span class='keyword'>Mutations</span> ordered 
by the percentage of segments exhibiting the mutation collected from <span class='domain'>human hosts</span> (instead of other kinds of hosts). 
The query can be customized to include a <span class='param'>limit</span> in the number of results and a 
<span class='param'>range</span> for the percentages.</p>

"
query_two_param_a_label: "Min: (default: 0%)"
query_two_param_b_label: "Max: (default: 100%)"
query_two_param_c_label: "Limit: "
query_two_error: "<h5>There are no mutations with a percentage of human hosts in the desired range</h5>"

# QUERY 3
query_three_label: "Get the most common aminoacid mutations for the selected serotype"
query_three_explanation: "<p style='text-align: justify;'>
This query returns all the <span class='keyword'>Mutations</span> of a particular 
<span class='keyword'>Serotype</span>, in particular the combination 
of their <span class='domain'>reference allele</span>, <span class='domain'>alternative allele</span> and position
sorted by the number of instances in the database.</p>
"
query_three_param_a_label: "Serotype:"
query_three_error: "<h5>There are no mutations for the selected serotype</h5>"

# QUERY 4
query_four_label: "Get the most common aminoacid mutations per annotation and serotype"
query_four_explanation: "<p style='text-align: justify;'>
This query returns all the <span class='keyword'>Mutations</span> for the given <span class='domain'>annotation</span>, 
in particular the combination of their <span class='domain'>reference allele</span>, 
<span class='domain'>alternative allele</span> and position
sorted by the number of instances in the database.</p>

"
query_four_param_a_label: "Annotation Name: "
query_four_param_b_label: "Serotype:"
query_four_error: "<h5>No mutations exists for the selected pair (annotation, serotype)</h5>"

# QUERY 5
query_five_label: "For each mutation get the number of segments that exhibit it, and the percentage over the total number of segments"
query_five_explanation: "<p style='text-align: justify;'>
For each identified <span class='keyword'>Mutation</span>, this query determines how many 
<span class='keyword'>Segments</span> of the dataset exhibit the mutation. 
Additionally, it calculates the percentage of these segments relative to the total number of 
segments in the dataset. This provides insight into the prevalence of each mutation within 
the entire set of segments, allowing to understand how common or rare each mutation is across the dataset."


# QUERY 6
query_six_label: "Retrieve the Markers that contain a specific Mutation"
query_six_explanation: "<p style='text-align: justify;'>
This query returns all the <span class='domain'>Markers</span> that 
are associated with a specific <span class='keyword'>Mutation</span></p>

# QUERY 7
query_seven_label: "Retrieve the marker (if any) associated to a group of mutations"

Given a group of <span class='keyword'>Mutations</span>, this query returns an <span class='domain'>Markers</span>
associated with at least all the mutations.

# QUERY 8
query_eight_label: "Identify Mutations at a specific Position"
query_eight_explanation: "<p style='text-align: justify;'>
This query returns all the <span class='keyword'>Mutations</span> that occur in a position inside the 
range (<span class='param'>Start</span>, <span class='param'>End</span>) [inclusive].
<br>The query is sorted on the <span class='keyword'>Position</span> itself.</p>
