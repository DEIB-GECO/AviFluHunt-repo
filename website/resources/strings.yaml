## QUERIES

# QUERY 1

explanation1:
  "<p class='query_text' style='text-align: justify;'>

  if any, for which they are all part of. Retrieve also the DOI for each 
  paper in which the groups were studied and the related 
  effect.
  </p>"

error1: "There is no known group for the selected markers"

# QUERY 2
label2: "Markers by relative percentage of human samples"
explanation2:
  "<p class='query_text'style='text-align: justify;'>

  of that marker and maximum total number of results.

  a specific country or that have been found in a selected Host.

error8: "There is no data for the selected subtype/segment combination"

# QUERY 9
label9: "Markers % presence"
explanation9:
  "<p class='query_text'style='text-align: justify;'>
  Get information on the relative percentage of markers in the dataset.<br>
  It is possible to restrict the search within a specified range and up to a limited number of results.
  </p>"
param_label9a: "Min %"
param_label9b: "Max %"
param_label9c: "Limit:"
error9: "There are no markers within the specified range of presence in the dataset"

# QUERY 10
label10: "Most mutated genomic regions"
explanation10:
  "<p class='query_text' style='text-align: justify;'>
  Find the most mutable zones (compared to a reference) within the dataset.<br>

  for each zone or by selecting a uniform size and an offset.
