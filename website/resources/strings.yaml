## QUERIES

# QUERY 1
label1: "1 - Obtain the literature associated to a group of Markers"
explanation1:
  "<p style='text-align: justify;'>
  Select Markers to obtain all the Groups of markers that contain each of them, 
  the Doi of the Paper that found the group and the effect that was studied to be
  associated with it.
  </p>"
param_label1a: "Marker Group:"
error1: "There is no known group for the selected markers"

# QUERY 2
label2: "2 - Get Markers by relative percentage of human samples"
explanation2:
  "<p style='text-align: justify;'>
  Get information about how often a Marker has infected human hosts.<br>
  It is possible to restrict the search by specifying a specific subtype and/or segment to consider and 
  filter the results based on a: range of human host percentage, minimum number of instances 
  of that marker and maximum number of results.

error2: "There are no markers within the specified filters"

# QUERY 3
label3: "3 - Get markers by difference in relative presence between two hosts"
explanation3:
  "<p style='text-align: justify;'>
  Get information on the difference in infection rate of Markers for the selected two Hosts.<br>
  It is also possible to specify further hosts (up to 5) to obtain their relative infection rates but results will be 
  provided ordered by the difference between the first two hosts only.

# QUERY 4
label4: "4 - Given a reference host, compare Marker presence other hosts"
explanation4:
  "<p style='text-align: justify;'>
  Get information on the presence of Markers in different Hosts. The first host will be used 
  to order results based on relative rate of infection. Other hosts (up to 5) can be specified to
  obtain information on their relative rate of infection for each Marker.
  </p>"

param_label4b: "Other Hosts:"
error4: "Error: This shouldn't happen"

# QUERY 5
label5: "5 - Given a Marker obtain its host distribution"

error5: "Error: This shouldn't happen"

# QUERY 6
label6: "6 - Given a Marker obtain the location distribution, normalized"
explanation6:
  "<p style='text-align: justify;'>
  Get information on the location markup of the selected Marker. <br>
  It is possible to restrict the search to a specific Region for more personalized results.<br><br>
  <b>Note: The results are normalized to account for the number of samples available for each location</b>
  </p>"
param_label6a: "Marker:"
param_label6b: "Region:"
error6: "Error: This shouldn't happen"

# QUERY 7
label7: "7 - Get the most common Marker"
explanation7:
  "<p style='text-align: justify;'>
  Get information on the most common (in absolute terms) Marker. <br>
  It is possible to restrict the results to a specific Subtype or/and Segment or to markers found in 
  a specific Country or that have been found in the selected Host.
  </p>"
param_label7a: "Subtype:"
param_label7b: "Segment:"
param_label7c: "Location:"
param_label7d: "Host:"
error7: "There are no markers within the specified filters"

# QUERY 8
label8: "8 - Get N. of instances of distinct Markers for each host"
explanation8:
  "<p style='text-align: justify;'>
  Get information on how many different Markers have infected the same Host.<br>
  It is possible to restrict the search to a specific Subtype and/or Segment.
  </p>"
param_label8a: "Subtype:"
param_label8b: "Segment:"
error8: "There is no data for the selected Subtype/Segment combination"

# QUERY 9
label9: "9 - Get how common is each Marker"
explanation9:
  "<p style='text-align: justify;'>

error9: "There are no Markers within the specified range of presence in the dataset"

# QUERY 10
label10: "10 - Find the Most Mutable Zones"
explanation10:
  "<p style='text-align: justify;'>
  Find the most mutable zones (compared to a reference) within the dataset.<br>
  For more interesting information it is possible to restrict the search to a specific Subtype and/or Segment.<br><br>
  Furthermore the zone of interest can be provided either by manually inserting start and end positions 
  for each zone or by selecting a uniform size and an offset.
