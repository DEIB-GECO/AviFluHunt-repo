explanation1:

  Select one or more <span class='im'>Markers</span> to retrieve all the <span class='im'>Groups</span>,
  if any, for which they are all part of. Retrieve also the <span class='im'>DOI</span> for each 
  <span class='im'>Paper</span> in which the groups were studied and the related 
  <span class='im'>Effect</span>.
  </p>"

# QUERY 2
label2: "Get Markers by relative percentage of human samples"
explanation2:
  "<p class='query_text'style='text-align: justify;'>

  In particular retrieve the percentage of human infections out of the total number of samples available.<br><br>
  It is possible to restrict the search by specifying a specific subtype and/or segment to be consider and 
  filter the results based on the range of human host percentage, the minimum number of instances 
  of that marker and maximum total number of results.

  It is possible to restrict the results to a specific Subtype or/and Segment or to markers found in 
  a specific Country or that have been found in a selected Host.
  </p>"

param_label8b: "Segment:"
error8: "There is no data for the selected Subtype/Segment combination"

# QUERY 9
label9: "Get how common is each Marker"
explanation9:
  "<p class='query_text'style='text-align: justify;'>
