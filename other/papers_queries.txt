1. Retrieve all markers associated with a particular mutation

SELECT marker_id FROM MutationsToMarker mtm
JOIN Mutation mut ON mut.mutation_id = mtm.mutation_id
WHERE mut.mutation_name = "H5N1:M2:L26F"

2. Get all effects associated with a specific mutation.

SELECT * FROM Effect e
WHERE e.effect_id in (
    SELECT pem.effect_id
    FROM MutationsToMarker mtm
    JOIN Marker m ON mtm.marker_id = m.marker_id   
    JOIN PaperAndEffectOfMarker pem ON m.marker_id = pem.marker_id
    WHERE mtm.mutation_id = 6501)


3. Identify mutations at a specific position.

SELECT mutation_name
FROM Mutation
WHERE position > 0
AND position < 1000

4. Retrieve all effects by specific type.

SELECT effect_full
from Effect
WHERE effect_type LIKE '%Increased%'
OR effect_type LIKE '%Decreased%'

6. Identify mutations associated with a particular effect type.

SELECT DISTINCT mut.mutation_name
FROM Mutation mut
JOIN MutationsToMarker mtm ON mut.mutation_id = mtm.mutation_id
JOIN Marker m ON mtm.marker_id = m.marker_id
JOIN PaperAndEffectOfMarker pem ON m.marker_id = pem.marker_id
JOIN Effect e ON pem.effect_id = e.effect_id
WHERE e.effect_type LIKE '%Increased%'
